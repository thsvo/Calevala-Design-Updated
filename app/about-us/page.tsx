                  The company was founded by two software enthusiasts who developed an SMS-based quiz game for a
                  nighttime-oriented broadcasting company. The game was played during the evening and nighttime on teletext.
                  Since the work required invoicing, establishing a company became necessary.

                  First and foremost, we collaborate with several universities of applied sciences in Finland, offering
                  training, thesis work opportunities, and job training placements. Additionally, we have some entry-level
                  job opportunities across Finland for athletes, as most of our work is location- and time-independentâ€”it
                  can be done from anywhere.

                  Angular, and React, following modern software development practices. We utilize Visual Studio as our
                  primary development environment, host our projects on Amazon AWS, and use Git for version control. Our
                  CI/CD pipeline is fully automated, and we conduct UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and QA (Quality Assurance)
                  testing to ensure reliability.

                  We integrate AI-driven tools and platforms, including LLMs (Large Language Models) and object detection
                  platforms. We work with annotations and use Jira for sprint management, frequently holding Google Meet and
                  Slack Huddles for discussions.

                  lead to learning rather than blame. We also embrace a "fail fast" mindset, encouraging rapid iteration and
                  continuous improvement.
